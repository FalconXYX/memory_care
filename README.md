# Memory Care - AI-Powered Memory Assistance

A Next.js application that combines face recognition with AI-powered text-to-speech for memory care assistance.

## Features

### Face Recognition System
- Real-time face detection and recognition using face-api.js
- Database-backed person management with relationships
- Live camera feed with overlay identification

### Gemini-Enhanced Text-to-Speech
- Text optimization using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model
- AI-enhanced text processing for more natural speech delivery
- Intelligent punctuation and pacing improvements
- High-quality speech synthesis with optimized parameters
- Interactive test interface with sample texts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Google Gemini API key with audio generation access ([Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- Access to Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your Gemini API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application

## Usage

### Face Recognition
1. Navigate to the main page and sign in
2. Click "ðŸ‘¥ Manage Registered Persons" to add people to the database
3. Return to the main page and start the camera to begin recognition

## API Endpoints
